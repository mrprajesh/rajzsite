Some say learning stops when you grow old. But, according to me 
**Learning**  begins from the day we are born till the our last breath. 
I am making a note of whatever I had(/have been) learnt(/learning) 
during my stay at IIT Madras.  

The following are :

- Shell scripting
- Makefile
- Git 
- Markdown
- $\LaTeX$
- [nvprof](https://gist.github.com/mrprajesh/352cbe661ee27a6b4627ae72d89479e6)
- [Handling a Lab course]({filename}/learn/labHacker.md)
- GrenMarl
- Pelican
- ...

 // Todo: will point more links as I update!
