Some say learning stops when you grow old. But, according to me 
**Learning**  begins from the day we are born till the our last breath. 
I am making a note of whatever I had(/have been) learnt(/learning) 
during my stay at IIT Madras.  Everyone you see in this world are here 
to teach you something new provided you are ready to listen and learn. 
Even a 2 year old kid can teach you provided you are patient and will to
listen.
