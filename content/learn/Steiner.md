## Problem Description

* Input: Graph $G(V,E)$, Cost function $c(E) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and 
		Terminals $L \subseteq V$.
* Output: Tree $T(V_T, E_T)$ and $L \subseteq V_T$  such that total cost $c(E_T)$ of tree is minimized.


###Initial  Observations:
- If $T = V$ then the problems reduces to Minimum Spannning Tree(MST) Problem.
- If $T = 2$ then the problems reduces to Shortest Path(SP) between two terminal vertices.


There are several exact as well as approximation algorithms for Minimal Steiner tree.

* MST Algorithm - 2 approx
* Greedy Algorithm - 2 approx
