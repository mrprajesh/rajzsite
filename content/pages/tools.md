## TCE SMS

## Online Fleet Management system using Global Positioning System.
It includes live tracking of vehicles fitted with GPS module([GM862 Evaluation Kit][5] is used for demonstration) 
through the web interface. It uses Google Maps API's. 
The Telit GPS module inside the kit is configured using Python. 
It get the GPS coordinates at a regualar interval and sends it to the web server through HTTP request 
(using GPRS available in the modem). It can send SMS alerts to the registered mobile on reaching specified locations using the GSM module in the kit(and Reverse Geocoding). 
Ofcourse, kit should have a dedicated SIM installed in it with GPRS/SMS capability. 
Apart from this, as a daily activity report generation plays a prominent role in recording the whereabouts of the vehicles. 
It is generated using [Jasper Reports][6].
