Rajesh graduated with Master's and PhD from the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering][1] at [IIT Madras][2] and a BTech from [Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai][7].
His work focuses on improving GPU's Compiler Performance during the day time, and wish to carry out research/teaching during his free time.
His broad research area is **parallelization** which includes <mark>GPU Computing</mark>, Graph Analytics and High-performance Computing (HPC).
Rajesh is passionate about every aspect of parallelizing graph algorithms/problems on GPUs. 
He has co-authored three international publications (including a Core A conference) and holds one Indian patent. 
Rajesh regularly serves as a Program Committee member in the Artifact Evaluation track of top conferences (such as CGO, PPoPP and SC) and subreviewer for HiPC.
He has received outstanding teaching assistant (STAR TA) award **thrice** at IIT Madras, second runner-up **twice** in 2008 and 2009 in IBMâ€™s the Great
Mind Challenge (TGMC), a prestigious National-level Contest and secured a top 10th place in [PACE 2018][8], and participated in [DIMACS 2021][9].

As an open-source advocate, all our publications' source codes are public to encourage the reproducibility of our experiments.


As I have an innate tendency to tinker and fix things, it adds more value to our time-bound projects to quickly resolve HPC/infrastructure issues and
focus on our research. I always document my technical encounters on [my blog](https://mrprajesh.co.in/blog) for later reference,
which is/was helpful for other members of our group and me.

<!--
Rajesh's PhD advisors are [Prof. N.S.Narayanaswamy][3] and [Prof. Rupesh Nasre][6]. 
Since I work at the intersection of both theory and practice, 

So, I am part of two labs: [Theoretical Computer Science][5] Group/Lab (fondly called as TCS Lab) and [PACE Lab.](https://pace.cse.iitm.ac.in/)

I will always go after the impossible things (for others) and passionate things (for me).
I have completed my bachelor's at [Thiagarajar College of Engineering][7].
I did my masters after a few years of a stint as a software engineer in the industry.
I have a great passion for GNU's Philosophy and Free & Open Source Software. My native is Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.

 I am a <s>grey-hat hacker </s> ssshh! ;-). I wish to be a grey-hat hacker. 

I love programming, computers and gadgets.
As a hobby, I sneak into websites by exploiting their weak spot and
eavesdrop, then I'll get out without traces.


Tell me something difficult to do with the computer,
I will show you a way to do it smarter and faster.
Yeah! That's what I am in one line. ;-)

My [PGP][4] Key ID is 0xEA64BABE.
If you wish to send me an encrypted email, you are always welcome! :-)

<!--
<mark> On job market--industry/academia. I am actively looking for **Researcher/PostDoc** positions in **GPU/Parallel Computing or HPC**. </mark>   <img src="images/new.gif" style="height: 1%;width: 5%;"/>
