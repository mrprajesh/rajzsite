My name is Rajesh Pandian M.
I am a final year PhD/Research Student in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering][1] at [IIT Madras][2].
I am advised by [Prof.N.S.Narayanaswamy][3] and [Prof. Rupesh Nasre][6]. 
My research areas are GPU/Parallel Computing, High-performance Computing and Graph Analytics.
I get excited about every aspect of parallelizing graph algorithms/problems on GPUs. 
As an open-source advocate, all our source codes are public to encourage the reproducibility of our experiments.


As I have an innate tendency to tinker and fix
things, it adds more value to our time-bound projects to quickly resolve infrastructure issues and
focus on research. I always document my technical endeavours on [my blog](https://mrprajesh.co.in/blog) for later reference,
which is helpful for other members of our group and me.

<!--
Since I work at the intersection of both theory and practice, 

So, I am part of two labs: [Theoretical Computer Science][5] Group/Lab (fondly called as TCS Lab) and [PACE Lab.](https://pace.cse.iitm.ac.in/)

I will always go after the impossible things (for others) and passionate things (for me).
I have completed my bachelor's at [Thiagarajar College of Engineering][7].
I did my masters after a few years of a stint as a software engineer in the industry.
I have a great passion for GNU's Philosophy and Free & Open Source Software. My native is Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.

 I am a <s>grey-hat hacker </s> ssshh! ;-). I wish to be a grey-hat hacker. 

I love programming, computers and gadgets.
As a hobby, I sneak into websites by exploiting their weak spot and
eavesdrop, then I'll get out without traces.


Tell me something difficult to do with the computer,
I will show you a way to do it smarter and faster.
Yeah! That's what I am in one line. ;-)
