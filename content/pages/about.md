My name is Rajesh Pandian M.
I am a Ph.D. Scholar in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering][1] at [IIT Madras][2].
Since I work at the intersection of both theory and practice
I am advised by [Prof.N.S.Narayanaswamy][3] and [Prof. Rupesh Nasre][6]. So, I am part of two labs: [Theoretical Computer Science][5] Group/Lab (fondly called TCS Lab) and [PACE Lab.](https://pace.cse.iitm.ac.in/)

I will always go after the impossible things (for others) and passionate things (for me).
I have completed my bachelor's at [Thiagarajar College of Engineering][7].
I did my masters after a few years of a stint as a software engineer in the industry.
I have a great passion for GNU's Philosophy and Free & Open Source Software. My native is Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.

I am a <s>grey-hat hacker </s> ssshh! ;-).
I wish to be a grey-hat hacker.
I love programming, computers and gadgets.
As a hobby, I sneak into websites by exploiting their weak spot and
eavesdrop, then I'll get out without traces.
Hmm, Tell me something difficult to do with the computer,
I will show you a way to do it smarter and faster.
Yeah! That's what I am in one line. ;-)

My [PGP][4] Key ID is 0xEA64BABE.
If you wish to send me an encrypted email, you are always welcome! :-)
