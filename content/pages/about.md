My name is Rajesh Pandian M. I am from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. 
I am a Ph.D. Scholar at [Department of Computer Science & Engineering][1] @ [IIT Madras][2]. 
I belong to [Theoretical Computer Science][5] Group/Lab fondly called as TCS Lab.
I am really fortunate to get [Prof.N.S.Narayanaswamy][3] as my Doctoral advisor.

I'll always go after the things that are impossible (to others) and passionate (to me). 
I have completed my under graduation at Thiagarajar College of Engineering. 
I did my masters after few years of stint as software engineer in industry. 
I have a great passion for GNU's Philosophy and Free & Open Source Software.

I am a <s>grey hat hacker </s> ..ssshh! ;-) . 
I wish to be a grey hat hacker. 
I love programming, computers and gadgets. 
As a hobby, I sneak into websites by exploiting their weakspot and 
eavesdrop then I'll get out. But never smoke'em down. 
Hmm, Tell me something that is difficult to do with computer 
I will show you a way to do it smarter and faster. 
Yeah! that's what I am in one line. ;-)
