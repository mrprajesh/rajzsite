My **area of research** includes Parallel/GPU Computing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Graph Analytics. 

I get excited about every aspect of Parallelization of Graph Algorithms on GPUs.

I am really fortunate to have my Ph.D. advisors as [N.S. Narayanaswamy][1] (also my M.Tech. project's advisor) and [Rupesh Nasre][3].

<!--- Both of them are wonderful professors/researchers I have ever met. From them, I have not just learnt doing research but also about good human values and other life+soft skills. -->


Quite recently, we have been working on these problems:

- Accelerating algorithms (approximate algorithms for NP-hard problems) using GPU. // Current
- Designing exact algorithm for NP-hard problems (Treewidth, Minimum fill-in and Steiner tree). // Done in [PACE][2] 
- Solving Problems(such as Dominating set) on Grid.  // Visualisation Tool for Algorithmic solving. Done.
- Designing Dynamic Data Structures for Graph Problems // During Masters. Done.

## Thesis
1. **Doctoral Thesis**
    - Title (Tentative): NP-hard Problems meet GPUs.
<!--    - [PDF](#) [slides](#) [Video](#)  // TODO. Later  -->
2. **Master Thesis**
    - Fully Dynamic Maximal Matching in 3-Uniform Hypergraphs.
<!--- [slides](#)  // TODO                                 -->
