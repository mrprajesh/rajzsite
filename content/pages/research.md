My **area of research** includes Parallel/GPU Computing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Graph Analytics. 

I get excited about every aspect of Parallelization of Graph Algorithms on GPUs.

I am really fortunate to have my Ph.D. advisors as [N.S. Narayanaswamy][1] (also my M.Tech. project's advisor) and [Rupesh Nasre][3].
Both of them are wonderful professors/researchers I have ever met. From them, I have not just learnt doing research but also about good human values and other life+soft skills.


Quite recently, we have been working on these problems:

- Accelerating algorithms (Approximate algorithms for NP-hard problems) using GPU. // Current
- Designing exact algorithm for NP-hard problems(Treewidth, Minimum fill-in and Steiner tree). // [PACE][2]
- Solving Problems(such as Dominating set) on Grid.  // Visualisation Tool for Algorithmic solving
- Designing Dynamic Data Structures for Graph Problems // During Masters

## Thesis
1. **Doctoral Thesis**
    - Title (Tentative): NP-hard Problems meet GPUs.

2. **Master Thesis**
    - Fully Dynamic Maximal Matching in 3-Uniform Hypergraphs.
