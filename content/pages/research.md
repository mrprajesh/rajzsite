Our **area of research** is Graph Algorithms. More specifically, accelerating the performance of Graph Algorithms on GPUs.

I am really fortunate to have my Ph.D. advisors as [N.S. Narayanaswamy][1] (also my M.Tech. project's advisor) and [Rupesh Nasre][3].
Both of them are wonderful professors/researchers I have ever met. From them, I have not just learnt doing research but also about good human values and other life+soft skills.


Quite recently, we have been working on these problems:

- Accelerating algorithms (exact and approximate for NP problems) using GPU. // Current
- Designing exact algorithm for NP-hard problems(Treewidth, Minimum fill-in, Steiner tree, Vertex Cover). // [PACE][2]
- Solving Problems(such as Dominating set) on Grid.  // Visualisation Tool for Algorithmic solving
- Designing Dynamic Data Structures for Graph Problems // M.Tech
