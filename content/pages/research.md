My Ph.D. advisor as well as my M.Tech. Project advisor is [Prof.N.S. Narayanaswamy][1].
The area of research is theoretical computer science and more specifically Graph Algorithms.
Probably one of few people from theory CS lab working on Experimental algorithms! 
Quite recently we are working on these problems:

- Accelerating algorithms(exact and approximate for NP problems) using GPU. // Current
- Designing exact algorithm for NP-hard problems(Treewidth, Minimum fill-in, Steiner tree, Vertex Cover). // [PACE][2]
- Solving Problems(such as Dominating set) on Grid.  // GUI Tool building
- Designing Dynamic Data Structures for Graph Problems // M.Tech
