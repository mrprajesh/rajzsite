My Ph.D. advisor as well as my M.Tech. Project advisor is [Prof.N.S. Narayanaswamy][1].
The area of research is theoretical computer science and more specifically Graph Algorithms.
Quite recently we are working on these problems.

- Designing Dynamic Data Structures for Graph Problems. 
- Designing exact algorithm for NP-hard problems(Treewidth, Minimum fill-in, Steiner tree).
- Solving Problems on Grid.
