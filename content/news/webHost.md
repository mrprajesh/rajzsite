# Site up
Mirroring my [cse site](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~mrprajesh/) on Github pages as [mrprajesh.github.io](http://mrprajesh.github.io) as well as [mrprajesh.co.in](http://mrprajesh.co.in)

My workflow to publish on domain took lesser time. Now, I can update the site quickly.

- Thanks to [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) - static site generator.
- Github pages - is my web-hosting space. It is free.
- For my domain, I had purchased two year co.in domain from Godaddy (800 INR) -- was un-parked 15 months.
- Added custom domain to Gh-pages and enabled `https` access for free. Thanks Github.
- Made some tinkering to theme.


This is `C/C++` language. Do you see the highlighting of `code blocks`.
It is due to [this](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/).

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	print("Hello There!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

This is `bash` or `shell `
```shell
rajz@LordOfWarriors:~$ cd ../tamil/
rajz@LordOfWarriors:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Dropbox  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
rajz@LordOfWarriors:~$ pwd
/home/tamil
```


okay, more later. Tata.
