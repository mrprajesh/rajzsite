We submitted to Transportation Science -  DIMACS special issue.
This submission was a different learning experience. ..writing up such that we project whatever good 
things we had and squeeze out even the tiny benefits from our approach 
-- was a nice learning experience. 
I had (and still have) the problem of writing my thoughts from my mind 
coherently, whereas I could explain them orally. I usually get 
distracted due to the typos I make, formatting and spelling mistakes, 
latex syntax errors+warnings and would miss the plot.

But, the Grammarly Chrome add-on helped me write many sentences and 
spellings correctly (directly on overleaf in place), which otherwise 
I would have written incorrectly.

> Alternative is to use a two-pass approach: Simply write main points in the first pass. The second pass can expand. Since the first pass is over, getting into typos will not deviate you from the larger context.
