After multiple attempts to publish our work at [ICPP]({filename}/news/Submission.md) and [PPoPP]({filename}/news/resubmit.md).
Our work on Steiner Tree is accepted for Publication at IJPP 2022.
This is my **first** and **latest** Research work. The research paper "Accelerating Computation of Steiner Trees on GPUs" with my advisors is published in the International Journal of Parallel Programming (IJPP) 2022.

Read here: [(PDF)][4] [(DOI)][5] [(Video)][6]. Thanks to my advisors for believing in me. This means a lot.
