Hello There! I made this website using [pelican][1].
The coolest	thing about pelican is you do not have to know html to create webpage.
I created a few text files (more preciely markdown files) and pelican generated the HTML files for me.
Of course you need know the markdown syntax -- That's is not hard too.
Moreover, I have enabled the render math add-on.
So, any $\LaTeX$ math symbols are rendered automatically.

Installing and setting up pelican takes only few minutes (or few commands).

### Render Math - Pelican plugins
Lets try some render math. $A_{m \times n} B_{n \times m} = C_{m \times m}$.
