Hello There! I made this website using [pelican][1]. 
The coolest	thing about pelican is you do not have to know html to create webpage.
I simply create a text file(markdown files) and it generates the HTML files for your.
Of course you need know the markdown syntax.
Moreover, I have enabled the render math add on. 
Any $\LaTeX$ math symbols are rendered automatically.

Installing and setting up pelican takes only few minutes (or few commands).

### Render Math - Pelican plugins
Lets try some render math. $A_{m \times n} B_{n \times m} = C_{m \times m}$.
