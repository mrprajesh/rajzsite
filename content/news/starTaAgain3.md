Rajesh is selected as one of the outstanding teaching assistant (**STAR TA**) for Jan-May 2021. Rajesh is getting award for the third time.
This time, it is for [CS1111 - Problem Solving Using Computers](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/course_details.php?arg=MTMz). Instructor is
[Jayalal Sarma](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~jayalal/). It was very challenging to conduct the lab course **online** due to pandemic situation. [Replit](replit.com) is our saviour without which it might have been a difficult task. CS1111 is a first-year programming course for CS under-graduates. [Last time](/recieved-star-ta-award-again.html)
