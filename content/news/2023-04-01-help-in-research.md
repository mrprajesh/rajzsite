Here are my thoughts/experiences which might help current/future students.

**TL;DR**. Participating in implementation challenges and pairing up helps research.

- This work evolved due to our participation in [DIMACS](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/programs/challenge/)[ Implementation Challenge](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/programs/challenge/). 
    - participating in such challenges helps us find the right problem to work on. //Important step for a research scholar.
    - Organisers curate the more challenging and more relevant inputs. 
    - Irrespective of competition results, it is a win-win for research. If we win, we will get recognised. If we do not, we get the baselines (winners' solution code) 
    - In either case, if we continue to work on it further, we will have a paper out of it.
    - Our earlier Steiner work (a result of another implementation Challenge -- [PACE](https://pacechallenge.org/)) had an excellent[ leaderboard](https://www.optil.io/optilion/problem/3025#tab-4) that quickly evaluated any new idea/heuristics we implemented. 
    - I wish we/I have a personal dashboard for every research problem we/I work on that also logs (with some scores/metrics) for every new heuristic/code version we attempt.
- Pairing up on research works (within and outside the group) always help. 
    - We had many brainstorming sessions (with/without advisors) with Somesh.
    - We had come up with several heuristics/ideas from those sessions. At times debugging too. 
    - That can push (to perform more) and pulls-up (whenever we feel low) each other. //It happened many times to me. 
    - If everything goes well, we will have one more paper (at least) out of this CVRP work.
    - Thanks a lot, Somesh.
