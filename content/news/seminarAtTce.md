Rajesh's gave an online seminar talk about doing research for the students of TCE.
Although Rajesh is not the perfect person (according to Rajesh ;-) to do so, Rajesh had shared the experiences of doing and writing up research works at IIT Madras.
The event was conducted as a part of alumni club of IT department. It happened on 04-Sep-2021 18:30. Always happy to contribute something to my [Alma mater](tce.edu).
